# Moodle-Registration
 The user story is to design web-app where the student   
 can view the number of moodle he/she is registered for in the semester.
   
 * Use jira as a project management tool
 * The requirement is to produce MVP as the starting point
   
 ## The ERD diagram 
   this is based on the customer's requirement to meet a deadline.  
 Therefore the approach is to design two database table with a one to many
  concept or relationship.  
 The two table are  
  * student table comprising of the following   
 student id  
 student surname  
 student forename  
  * moodle table comprising of the following
 moodle id
 moodle name
